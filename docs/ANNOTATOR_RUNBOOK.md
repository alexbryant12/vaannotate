# Annotator Runbook â€” Project Toy

> Admins prepare your folder by running `python tools\seed_toy_project.py` (or `scripts\new_toy_project.ps1`).

1. Navigate to your assignment folder on the shared drive:
   `.../phenotypes/ph_diabetes/rounds/round_1/assignments/<your_id>/`.
2. Inside the folder, open `scripts` and double-click `run_client.ps1`.
   - Alternatively, double-click `client.exe` directly.
3. The client opens with three panes:
   - **Left**: list of notes/patients (bold = not yet viewed).
   - **Middle**: note text. Scroll to read the entire document.
   - **Right**: label form.
4. Use the **Rules** button to review label definitions at any time.
5. Highlight text in the middle pane and **right-click** to attach supporting evidence to a label.
6. Fill in every required field. The **Next** button stays disabled until all required labels are satisfied (or marked N/A where allowed).
7. Move through each unit until the progress bar hits 100%.
8. Select **Submit** when complete, then close the app. The assignment database updates in place.
