WORKED TOY EXAMPLE QUICKSTART
=============================

1. Download or copy this folder to a shared network location accessible to reviewers.
   *Example: \\server\share\Project_Toy\*
2. Unzip the archive if needed.
3. Hydrate the toy workspace (binaries are not stored in Git):
   - Double-click `scripts\new_toy_project.ps1`, **or**
   - Run `python tools\seed_toy_project.py` from a terminal.
   The script recreates `demo\Project_Toy\`, the reviewer assignments, and placeholder clients.
4. In the Admin window (opens automatically from the PowerShell script), browse the project to review the seeded round.
5. For annotation, have each reviewer open their assignment folder under
   `phenotypes\ph_diabetes\rounds\round_1\assignments\<reviewer_id>\`.
6. Inside that folder, double-click `scripts\run_client.ps1` (or `client.exe` directly).
   - The annotator client launches and loads the assignment database.
7. Annotate all units. The **Next** button remains disabled until every required label is set (or N/A when allowed).
8. When 100% complete, click **Submit** in the client and close the application.
