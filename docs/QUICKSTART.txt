WORKED TOY EXAMPLE QUICKSTART
=============================

1. Download or copy this folder to a shared network location accessible to reviewers.
   *Example: \\server\share\Project_Toy\*
2. Unzip the archive if needed.
3. Hydrate the toy workspace (binaries are not stored in Git):
   - Open an Anaconda Prompt, run `conda activate vaannotate`, then execute
     `python tools\seed_toy_project.py` from the repository root.
   The script recreates `demo\Project_Toy\`, the reviewer assignments, and placeholder clients.
4. Launch the Admin app from the same Conda prompt with `python -m vaannotate.AdminApp.main`, then
   use **File → Open project folder…** to browse to the toy project and review the seeded round.
5. For annotation, have each reviewer open their assignment folder under
   `phenotypes\ph_diabetes\rounds\round_1\assignments\<reviewer_id>\`.
6. Inside that folder, either run `python -m vaannotate.ClientApp.main` from an activated
   Conda prompt or double-click `client.exe` if you built the standalone binary.
   - The annotator client launches and loads the assignment database.
7. Annotate all units. The **Next** button remains disabled until every required label is set (or N/A when allowed).
8. When 100% complete, click **Submit** in the client and close the application.
